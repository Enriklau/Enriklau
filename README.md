- 👋 Hi, I’m @Enriklau
- 👀 I’m interested in 2D game development and solving mathematical problems. Most of my coding so far has been done in Gamemaker Studio 1.4 using the GML scripting language.
- 🌱 I’m currently looking into C# and Unity.
- 💞️ This repository is mostly used for archival purposes. Most of the stuff here is of a more experimental nature and goes into other projects in the long run.
